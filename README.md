# Corne Mini Keymap

A keymap for a 34 keys Corne Mini, based on the one I use for my [Ferris Sweep](#)

It defaults to Colemak, includes support for QWERTY, and makes heavy use of mod tap (for mods in the home row) and combos (because I'm lazy like that and taking my fingers off the home row is not fun).

There's also a bunch of app shortcuts baked in (TextMate, NotePlan, Sketch) that probably only make sense to me.

The keymap per se doesn't do much, and all the magic is actually on my [QMK user folder](https://github.com/bomberstudios/qmk_user_folder)
