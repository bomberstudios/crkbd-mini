# Corne Mini Layout

My personal layout for the Corne Mini (3x5)

Some features (in no particular order):

- QWERTY by default, with support for Colemak in a layer
- Home Row Mods
- Mac only
- Optimised for my personal workflow (I have many shortcuts for Sketch & TextMate). So maybe you can use it for inspiration, but probably not to use as-is
- Minimal hardware: no OLED, no LED, no RGB... (my mini doesn't even have a case)
